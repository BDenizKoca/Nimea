# The Empire of Aurelius

The Empire of Aurelius is the dominant human power in the central regions of Nimea, spanning from the Sapphire Coast in the east to the Dragonspine Mountains in the west.

## History

Founded over a thousand years ago by Emperor Aurelius the Wise, the empire began as a small city-state that gradually expanded through both military conquest and diplomatic alliances. Over the centuries, it has experienced periods of great prosperity and decline, but has always remained a central power in Nimean politics.

## Government

The Empire is ruled by an Emperor or Empress who holds absolute authority, though in practice power is shared with the Imperial Senate, composed of representatives from the noble houses and conquered territories. The current ruler is Empress Lysandra II, known for her shrewd diplomacy and reforms to expand education throughout the realm.

## Military

The famed Aurelian Legions are among the most disciplined and well-equipped fighting forces in Nimea. Each legion consists of 5,000 soldiers organized into cohorts, supported by cavalry and, in some cases, battlemages from the Imperial Arcane Academy.

## Major Cities

- **Aurelium**: The capital and largest city, home to over 200,000 people
- **Hammergard**: A major mining center and fortress city in the north
- **Azurehaven**: The empire's primary port and center of trade
- **Silverkeep**: Known for its great library and academic institutions
