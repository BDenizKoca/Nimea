# Aurelium

Aurelium is the magnificent capital of the Empire of Aurelius and the largest city in all of Nimea, home to over 200,000 residents from all corners of the known world.

## Geography

Built on seven hills overlooking the mighty River Argentus, Aurelium occupies a strategically valuable position that controls trade along the river while being naturally defensible. The city is surrounded by massive walls of white stone, said to have been enhanced with ancient magic to withstand siege weapons and spells alike.

## Districts

### The Imperial District
Dominating the central hill is the Imperial Palace, a sprawling complex of marble buildings, gardens, and courtyards where the Empress and her court reside. Nearby stands the Imperial Senate, the Temple of the Seven Virtues, and the headquarters of the Imperial Legions.

### The Noble District
Home to the mansions and estates of Aurelium's aristocracy, this district features tree-lined avenues, private gardens, and exquisite architecture. Many noble houses maintain their own guards and small private armies.

### The Merchant District
The economic heart of the city, filled with markets, guildhalls, banks, and trading companies. The Grand Bazaar is said to offer goods from every corner of Nimea and beyond.

### The Arcane Quarter
Centered around the Imperial Arcane Academy, this district houses mages, alchemists, and scholars. Strange lights and sounds are common here, and the architecture often defies the conventional laws of physics.

### The Commons
Where most of the city's ordinary citizens live and work, this sprawling district contains countless workshops, taverns, inns, and modest homes. Despite its crowded nature, the Commons are generally well-maintained and policed.

### The Undercity
Beneath Aurelium lies a maze of ancient sewers, catacombs, and forgotten ruins from civilizations that preceded the Empire. Thieves, cultists, and more sinister entities are rumored to lurk in these depths.
