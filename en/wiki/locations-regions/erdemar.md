# **Erdemar**

*Across the lake from Silvaron, Erdemar is known for its long pier and bustling marketplace, a vibrant port city where fish, grain, and timber change hands, and the pulse of the lake is felt.*

## **The Pulse of the Lake**

Erdemar sits on the far shore of Lake Erden, built in a sheltered bay away from the wind—a true heart of lake trade. From Silvaron, the city’s stone walls and red-tiled roofs stretch along the waterfront like a line of sentinels. At dawn, the city wakes to the sound of a bell rising through the mist; those heading to market set out, a cool breeze from the water following their steps.

## **Piers and the Sound of the Market**

Erdemar’s long docks fill early with fishing boats and, by midday, with barges loaded with grain and timber. The market square, shaped like a crescent, opens toward the water; stone steps lead down to the lake, and stone warehouses stay cool in the shade. Every pier is a tangle of weights, ropes, nets, and the voices of busy craftsmen. In the evenings, racing boats glide across the lake and lanterns swinging on the piers become part of the city’s memory.

## **Daily Life and Rituals**

In Erdemar, as in Silvaron, a bell rings once each morning and the master scale is carefully checked. Merchants do not sell before receiving the day’s official seal; the order of the market is built on honest measures and trust. Children fish from the docks, while elders linger in the shade of the warehouses. On festival days, there are contests for net casting and quick loading by the water.

## **Governance and Trade**

The city is governed by the king’s eldest son. Laws are clear: no tolerance for scale fraud, unauthorized docks, or unregistered cargo. Lake fish, salted fish, and barley bread are daily fare; timber and charcoal from Arkun are stamped in Silvaron and then traded here.

## **Colors, Symbols, and Troubles**

Amber and white are the city’s colors; a blue ribbon is added on race days. In recent years, as the water recedes, old stones reappear along Taşyol Bank and strange whispers are heard at night. Unfamiliar knots are sometimes found on the dock pilings come morning. Despite all these oddities, the Erdemar market remains the heartbeat of the lake.
