# **Durassa**

*A walled port city known for its discipline and strict neutrality. Its Chain Tower and heavy harbor chain mark it as the sentinel of the coast.*


## **Sentinel of the Shore**

Built in a natural bay facing the open sea, Durassa stands where land meets water. The stone walls rising from the shoreline and the chain drawn across the harbor ensure that every ship greets the city with due respect. To an outsider’s eye, the port’s quiet order is obvious from afar. The day begins with the sound of keys and bells; in the evening, the chain is checked before night falls.

## **The Harbor and Daily Life**

Trade in Durassa moves with patience and routine. No cargo is unloaded without proper records and seals. The day’s work starts with a key ceremony in the morning, continues with a brief auction at midday, and is carried on through busy warehouses until dusk. Everyone knows their task; who unloads when at the docks, and which goods will change hands first at market, are all well established. At night, patrol boats check the security of the chain.

## **Walls, Rules, and Leadership**

The city is governed by the Council of Keys, formed by merchant families and two admirals. Decisions are not delayed; the harbor chain and keys are always kept in separate hands, and everyone knows their boundaries. Breaking the rules carries a heavy price, though disputes are seldom noisy.

## **Faiths and Colors**

Here, great respect is shown to Kulusta, guardian of trade, while Pelagris is briefly invoked before every voyage. The city’s colors are grey and black, with a golden key on the flags. When the chain is drawn, the harbor seems to fall quiet for a moment—some call it luck, others simply go about their business.
