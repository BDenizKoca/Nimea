# **Iskelya**

*The Silvar Kingdom’s gate to the sea. Known for its harbor chain, lighthouse, and salt farms.*


## **The Gate to the Sea**

Surrounded by stone walls that face wind and wave, Iskelya is the main gateway of the Silvar Kingdom to the outside world. Massive breakwaters stretch into the bay and stout harbor walls encircle the city, speaking to its sense of security. At dawn, the lighthouse beam is dimmed, the harbor chain checked, and the day begins with the first sound of the horn along the shore.

## **The Lighthouse and Harbor Order**

At the city’s tip stands the lighthouse, welcoming those who return from the open sea at night. The harbor chain is lowered only at the signal of the watch captain; no vessel may enter while the chain is drawn. No cargo may be unloaded without a proper manifest and seal. In the morning light, the salt farms glimmer like strings of pearls, and sacks of salt are neatly lined up. Local boats crowd the inner docks, while foreign goods and guests are welcomed at the outer wharves.

## **Daily Life and Tradesmen’s Customs**

Every morning, a single bell is rung on the docks, and the keys are checked. Rope makers and net weavers recite a short prayer in front of the lighthouse. When unloading cargo, order is strictly observed; the customs officer and guard patrol together without pause. Meals are simple: salted fish, barley bread, onions, and pickles. On days of departure, lantern walks are held around the lighthouse, and voyages are declared at Captains’ Square.

## **Governance and Coastal Security**

The city is ruled by the king’s younger son; two captains ensure order and safety at the harbor. The keys are never kept by a single hand; the chain can only be lowered with a joint seal. Cargo records go to Silvaron, while salt tax is sent directly to the royal treasury. After storms, salvage rights on the open sea are strictly observed, and smuggling is not tolerated.

## **Symbols, Colors, and City Secrets**

Iskelya’s emblem is a white lighthouse encircled by silver waves on a navy field. The city’s colors are navy and white, with a gold ribbon added on sailing days. On foggy nights, false lights sometimes appear on the open sea; by morning, only the sound of water remains. In recent years, the still waters of the salt pans have begun to move unexpectedly. Despite all this, Iskelya remains the Silvar Kingdom’s sole harbor and its most open gate.
