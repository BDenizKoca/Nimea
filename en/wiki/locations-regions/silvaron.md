# **Silvaron**  
*The Lake Gate of the Seven Domes*

## **A Throne Built at the River’s Mouth**  
Silvaron stands where Lake Altun narrows into the Erden River—a natural chokepoint where the capital of the Silvar Kingdom controls trade and sovereignty alike.  
With ridgelines to the west and the Arkun Forest to the east, its location is both strategic and beautiful. The city is known for its arched stone bridges, chain towers, and lakeside granaries. From the Crown Square, the morning bell rings out as cranes creak into motion.

## **The City of the Scales**  
Each Monday, a new color is stamped onto the market scales. At dawn, the priest of Leksai and the Master Weigher of the Scalewrights’ Guild unlock the Oath Chest together. Merchants bring their weights to be tested and sealed.  
The market is laid out in a crescent ring. Fraudulent measurements are not tolerated—trust in weights is trust in law. In Silvaron, justice is measured in grams.

## **In the Shadow of the Domes**  
Silvaron’s skyline is crowned by seven domes, each dedicated to one of the Sacred Seven: Aevitan, Seresis, Magus, Pelagris, Nimea, Leksai, and Mahartus.  
The largest dome hosts coronations; nearby squares hold the statue of Aevitan. Chapels to Seresis and Nimea lie near the market; the Archive of Magus serves scribes and mapmakers.  
Everything in the city has its place—and every measurement its ledger.

## **Trade, Crafts, and Waters**  
Silvaron’s shoreline stirs with fishers drying nets and cranes loading grain. The city thrives on fishing, flax weaving, grain storage, and riverboat repair.  
Timber and mining—charcoal, quarried stone, and building wood—are regulated along mountain and forest routes.  
Basket weavers and reed-workers line the docks; watchtowers light up the lakeside at dusk.

## **Throne, Council, and Allies**  
Though the king’s seat is in Silvaron, governance is not absolute. His sons rule the cities of Erdemar and Iskelya, while the Council of Kings meets here in session.  
Inland towns follow Silvaron’s standards; trade taxes along the coast flow back to the capital. Lake Erden connects both shores—and both realms.

## **Ritual and Daily Life**  
At sunrise, lighthouse beacons are extinguished and the bell rings once. Merchants bring their scales to be checked before the first sale.  
Lake fish soup, barley bread, and boatman’s cheese make up the common breakfast.  
During festivals, adorned boats race across the water, and Seresis is honored in harvest parades.  
In Silvaron, life moves quietly and deliberately—yet every measure is itself a ritual.
